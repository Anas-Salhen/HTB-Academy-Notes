# DNS
## How It Works
1. `Your Computer Asks for Directions (DNS Query)`: When you enter the domain name, your computer first checks its memory (cache) to see if it remembers the IP address from a previous visit. If not, it reaches out to a DNS resolver, usually provided by your internet service provider (ISP).

2. `The DNS Resolver Checks its Map (Recursive Lookup)`: The resolver also has a cache, and if it doesn't find the IP address there, it starts a journey through the DNS hierarchy. It begins by asking a root name server, which is like the librarian of the internet.

3. `Root Name Server Points the Way`: The root server doesn't know the exact address but knows who does – the Top-Level Domain (TLD) name server responsible for the domain's ending (e.g., .com, .org). It points the resolver in the right direction.

4. `TLD Name Server Narrows It Down`: The TLD name server is like a regional map. It knows which authoritative name server is responsible for the specific domain you're looking for (e.g., `example.com`) and sends the resolver there.

5. `Authoritative Name Server Delivers the Address`: The authoritative name server is the final stop. It's like the street address of the website you want. It holds the correct IP address and sends it back to the resolver.

6. `The DNS Resolver Returns the Information`: The resolver receives the IP address and gives it to your computer. It also remembers it for a while (caches it), in case you want to revisit the website soon.

7. `Your Computer Connects`: Now that your computer knows the IP address, it can connect directly to the web server hosting the website, and you can start browsing.

## The Hosts File
The `hosts` file is a simple text file used to map hostnames to IP addresses. It is located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows and in `/etc/hosts` on Linux and MacOS. It looks something like:
```txt
127.0.0.1       localhost
192.168.1.10    devserver.local
```
We can edit this file to achieve things like:
- Redirecting a domain to a local server for development.
- Testing connectivity by specifying an IP address.
- Blocking unwanted websites by redirecting their domains to a non-existent IP address.

## DNS Zone
A zone is a distinct part of the domain namespace that a specific entity manages. For example, `example.com` and all its subdomains (like `mail.example.com` or `blog.example.com`) would typically belong to the same DNS zone.

The zone file, a text file residing on a DNS server, has a lot of important records. It looks similar to this: 
```dns-zone
$TTL 3600 ; Default Time-To-Live (1 hour)
@       IN SOA   ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                2024060401 ; Serial number (YYYYMMDDNN)
                3600       ; Refresh interval
                900        ; Retry interval
                604800     ; Expire time
                86400 )    ; Minimum TTL

@       IN NS    ns1.example.com.
@       IN NS    ns2.example.com.
@       IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
www     IN A     192.0.2.1
mail    IN A     198.51.100.1
ftp     IN CNAME www.example.com.
```
First let's explore common DNS concepts:

| DNS Concept                 | Description                                                            | Example                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `DNS Resolver`              | A server that translates domain names into IP addresses.               | Your ISP's DNS server or public resolvers like Google DNS (`8.8.8.8`)                                                                   |
| `Root Name Server`          | The top-level servers in the DNS hierarchy.                            | There are 13 root servers worldwide, named A-M: `a.root-servers.net`                                                                    |
| `TLD Name Server`           | Servers responsible for specific top-level domains (e.g., .com, .org). | [Verisign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisign) for `.com`, [PIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Registry) for `.org` |
| `Authoritative Name Server` | The server that holds the actual IP address for a domain.              | Often managed by hosting providers or domain registrars.                                                                                |
| `DNS Record Types`          | Different types of information stored in DNS.                          | A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, etc.                                                                                                       |
## Record Types
| Record Type | Full Name                 | Description                                                                                                                                 | Zone File Example                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| `NS`        | Name Server Record        | Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.                                                                               | `example.com.` IN NS `ns1.example.com.`                                                        |
| `TXT`       | Text Record               | Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies.                                                 | `example.com.` IN TXT `"v=spf1 mx -all"` (SPF record)                                          |
| `SOA`       | Start of Authority Record | Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters. | `example.com.` IN SOA `ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400` |
| `SRV`       | Service Record            | Defines the hostname and port number for specific services.                                                                                 | `_sip._udp.example.com.` IN SRV 10 5 5060 `sipserver.example.com.`                             |
| `PTR`       | Pointer Record            | Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname.                                                                          | `1.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa.` IN PTR `www.example.com.`                                            |
The "`IN`" in the examples stands for "Internet." It's a class field in DNS records that specifies the protocol family. In most cases, you'll see "`IN`" used, as it denotes the Internet protocol suite (IP) used for most domain names. Other class values exist (e.g., `CH` for Chaosnet, `HS` for Hesiod) but are rarely used in modern DNS configurations.

## Why DNS Matters for Web Recon
- `Uncovering Assets`: subdomains, mail servers, and name server records.
- `Mapping the Network Infrastructure`: For example, identifying the name servers (`NS` records) for a domain can reveal the hosting provider used, while an `A` record for `loadbalancer.example.com` can pinpoint a load balancer.
- `Monitoring for Changes`: For example, the sudden appearance of a new subdomain (`vpn.example.com`) might indicate a new entry point into the network, while a `TXT` record containing a value like `_1password=...` strongly suggests the organization is using 1Password, which could be leveraged for social engineering attacks or targeted phishing campaigns.

# Subdomains
## Why Subdomains are Important for Recon
- `Development and Staging Environments`: Companies often use subdomains to test new features or updates before deploying them to the main site. Due to relaxed security measures, these environments sometimes contain vulnerabilities or expose sensitive information.
- `Hidden Login Portals`: Subdomains might host administrative panels or other login pages that are not meant to be publicly accessible. Attackers seeking unauthorized access can find these as attractive targets.
- `Legacy Applications`: Older, forgotten web applications might reside on subdomains, potentially containing outdated software with known vulnerabilities.
- `Sensitive Information`: Subdomains can inadvertently expose confidential documents, internal data, or configuration files that could be valuable to attackers.

## Subdomain Enumeration
### Active
This involves directly interacting with the target domain's DNS servers to uncover subdomains. One method is attempting a `DNS zone transfer`, where a misconfigured server might inadvertently leak a complete list of subdomains, but this is rarely successful.

A more common active technique is `brute-force enumeration`, which involves systematically testing a list of potential subdomain names against the target domain.

### Passive
This relies on external sources of information to discover subdomains without directly querying the target's DNS servers. One valuable resource is `Certificate Transparency (CT) logs`, public repositories of SSL/TLS certificates. These certificates often include a list of associated subdomains in their Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field.

Another passive approach involves utilizing `search engines` like Google. By employing search operators (e.g., `site:`), you can filter results to show only subdomains related to the target domain.

# Subdomain Bruteforcing
Steps:
1. `Wordlist Selection`, these wordlists can be:
    - `General-Purpose`: Containing a broad range of common subdomain names (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `blog`, `mail`, `admin`, `test`). This approach is useful when you don't know the target's naming conventions.
    - `Targeted`: Focused on specific industries, technologies, or naming patterns relevant to the target. This approach is more efficient and reduces the chances of false positives.
    - `Custom`: You can create your own wordlist based on specific keywords, patterns, or intelligence gathered from other sources.
2. `Iteration and Querying`: A script or tool iterates through the wordlist, appending each word or phrase to the main domain to create potential subdomain names (e.g., `dev.example.com`, `staging.example.com`).
3. `DNS Lookup`: A DNS query is performed for each potential subdomain to check if it resolves to an IP address. This is typically done using the A or AAAA record type.
4. `Filtering and Validation`: If a subdomain resolves successfully, it's added to a list of valid subdomains. Further validation steps might be taken to confirm the subdomain's existence and functionality (e.g., by attempting to access it through a web browser).

## DNS Enum
The tool offers several key functions:
- `DNS Record Enumeration`: `dnsenum` can retrieve various DNS records.
- `Zone Transfer Attempts`: The tool automatically attempts zone transfers from discovered name servers.
- `Subdomain Brute-Forcing`: It supports brute-force enumeration of subdomains using a wordlist.
- `Google Scraping`: The tool can scrape Google search results to find additional subdomains that might not be listed in DNS records directly.
- `Reverse Lookup`: It can perform reverse DNS lookups to identify domains associated with a given IP address, potentially revealing other websites hosted on the same server.
- `WHOIS Lookups`: The tool can also perform WHOIS queries to gather information about domain ownership and registration details.

Example:
```bash
dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com -f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt -r
```
- `dnsenum --enum inlanefreight.com`: We specify the target domain we want to enumerate, along with a shortcut for some tuning options `--enum`.
- `-f /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-20000.txt`: We indicate the path to the SecLists wordlist we'll use for brute-forcing. Adjust the path if your SecLists installation is different.
- `-r`: This option enables recursive subdomain brute-forcing, meaning that if `dnsenum` finds a subdomain, it will then try to enumerate subdomains of that subdomain.

# DNS Zone Transfers
A DNS zone transfer is essentially a wholesale copy of all DNS records within a zone (a domain and its subdomains) from one name server to another. This process is essential for maintaining consistency and redundancy across DNS servers. However, if not adequately secured, unauthorized parties can download the entire zone file.

## Process
1. `Zone Transfer Request (AXFR)`: The secondary DNS server initiates the process by sending a zone transfer request to the primary server. This request typically uses the AXFR (Full Zone Transfer) type.
2. `SOA Record Transfer`: Upon receiving the request (and potentially authenticating the secondary server), the primary server responds by sending its (SOA) record which contains vital information about the zone, including its serial number, which helps the secondary server determine if its zone data is current.
3. `DNS Records Transmission`: The primary server then transfers all the DNS records in the zone to the secondary server, one by one.
4. `Zone Transfer Complete`: Once all records have been transmitted, the primary server signals the end of the zone transfer. This notification informs the secondary server that it has received a complete copy of the zone data.
5. `Acknowledgement (ACK)`: The secondary server sends an acknowledgement message to the primary server, confirming the successful receipt and processing of the zone data. This completes the zone transfer process.

## Importance
Unauthorized zone transfers give the hacker important info like:
- `Subdomains`: A complete list of subdomains, many of which might not be linked from the main website or easily discoverable through other means. These hidden subdomains could host development servers, staging environments, administrative panels, or other sensitive resources.
- `IP Addresses`: The IP addresses associated with each subdomain, providing potential targets for further reconnaissance or attacks.
- `Name Server Records`: Details about the authoritative name servers for the domain, revealing the hosting provider and potential misconfigurations.

Back in the day zone transfers could be requested by anyone which made administration easier but was a big security issue. Now modern DNS servers only allow trusted secondary servers to request zone transfers. 

It's still worth trying a zone transfer since there is a possibility that misconfigurations exist. We can use `dig` to query a nameserver (i.e. `nsztm1.digi.ninja`) for a zone transfer of a specific domain (i.e. `zonetransfer.me`):
```shell-session
AnasSalhen@htb[/htb]$ dig axfr @nsztm1.digi.ninja zonetransfer.me
```

# Virtual Hosts
Virtual hosting is the ability of web servers to distinguish between multiple websites or applications sharing the same IP address. This is achieved by leveraging the HTTP `Host` header.

## Types of Virtual Hosting
1. `Name-Based Virtual Hosting`: This method relies solely on the `HTTP Host header` to distinguish between websites. It is the most common and flexible method, as it doesn't require multiple IP addresses. It’s cost-effective, easy to set up, and supports most modern web servers. However, it requires the web server to support name-based `virtual hosting` and can have limitations with certain protocols like `SSL/TLS`.
2. `IP-Based Virtual Hosting`: This type of hosting assigns a unique IP address to each website hosted on the server. The server determines which website to serve based on the IP address to which the request was sent. It doesn't rely on the `Host header`, can be used with any protocol, and offers better isolation between websites. Still, it requires multiple IP addresses, which can be expensive and less scalable.
3. `Port-Based Virtual Hosting`: Different websites are associated with different ports on the same IP address. For example, one website might be accessible on port 80, while another is on port 8080. `Port-based virtual hosting` can be used when IP addresses are limited, but it’s not as common or user-friendly as `name-based virtual hosting` and might require users to specify the port number in the URL.

## Virtual Host Discovery Tools
Tools include: [gobuster](https://github.com/OJ/gobuster), [Feroxbuster](https://github.com/epi052/feroxbuster) and [ffuf](https://github.com/ffuf/ffuf).

### gobuster
Commonly used for directory and file brute-forcing, but it also excels at virtual host discovery. It systematically sends HTTP requests with different `Host` headers to a target IP address. The command generally looks like:
```shell-session
[!bash!]$ gobuster vhost -u http://<target_IP_address> -w <wordlist_file> --append-domain
```
The `--append-domain` flag appends the base domain to each word in the wordlist. Other arguments worth knowing are `-t` to increase the number of threads for faster scanning, `-k` to ignore SSL/TLS certificate errors and `-o` to save the output to a file for later analysis.

Virtual host discovery can generate significant traffic and might be detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS) or web application firewalls (WAF). Exercise caution and obtain proper authorization before scanning any targets.

# Certificate Transparency Logs
SSL/TLS is a protocol responsible for encrypting communication between the browser and the a website. At the heart of SSL/TLS lies the `digital certificate`, a small file that verifies a website's identity and allows for secure, encrypted communication. But certificates can be exploited which is why we need Certificate Transparency (CT) logs.

Whenever a Certificate Authority (CA) issues a new certificate it must submit it to multiple CT logs. This serves many purposes:
- `Early Detection of Rogue Certificates`: By monitoring CT logs, security researchers and website owners can quickly identify suspicious or misissued certificates. A rogue certificate is an unauthorized or fraudulent digital certificate issued by a trusted certificate authority. Detecting these early allows for swift action to revoke the certificates before they can be used for malicious purposes.
- `Accountability for Certificate Authorities`: CT logs hold CAs accountable for their issuance practices. If a CA issues a certificate that violates the rules or standards, it will be publicly visible in the logs, leading to potential sanctions or loss of trust.
- `Strengthening the Web PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)`: The Web PKI is the trust system underpinning secure online communication. CT logs help to enhance the security and integrity of the Web PKI by providing a mechanism for public oversight and verification of certificates.

## Searching CT Logs
CT logs provide a reliable and efficient way to discover subdomains without the need for exhaustive brute-forcing or relying on the completeness of wordlists. Tools:
- [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/)
	- Pros: Free, easy to use, no registration required.
	- Cons: Limited filtering and analysis options.
- [Censys](https://search.censys.io/)
	- Pros: Extensive data and filtering options, API access.
	- Cons: Requires registration (free tier available).

## crt.sh
While it has a convenient web interface we can also use it from the terminal: 
```shell-session
curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json" | jq -r '.[]
 | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value' | sort -u
```
- `curl -s "https://crt.sh/?q=facebook.com&output=json"`: This command fetches the JSON output from crt.sh for certificates matching the domain `facebook.com`.
- `jq -r '.[] | select(.name_value | contains("dev")) | .name_value'`: This part filters the JSON results, selecting only entries where the `name_value` field (which contains the domain or subdomain) includes the string "`dev`". The `-r` flag tells `jq` to output raw strings.
- `sort -u`: This sorts the results alphabetically and removes duplicates.
