# Virtual Private Server (VPS)
It is an isolated environment created on a physical server using virtualization technology, it is considered IaaS. It allows us to configure **without restrictions** and uses the resources of a physical server to provide **server functionalities** which is why it's also called Virtual Dedicated ServerÂ **(VDS).**
It is a compromise between inexpensive shared hosting and the usually costly rental of dedicated server technology.

Uses for VPS:

| Webserver          | LAMP/XAMPP stack | Mail server   | DNS server      |
| ------------------ | ---------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Development server | Proxy server     | Test server   | Code repository |
| Pentesting         | VPN              | Gaming server | C2 server       |

Common VPS providers include: [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/products/cloud-compute/), [Linode](https://www.linode.com/pricing/), [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/pricing), [OneHostCloud](https://onehostcloud.hosting/).

## Securing the Network
Tools:
1. [Netbird](https://netbird.io/): excels in use cases requiring simple, automated setup for secure access to cloud and on-premises resources, like connecting developer workstations to private repositories.
2. [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/): a WireGuard-based virtual private cloud and requires minimal configuration which makes it perfect for use cases such as securing remote employees connections to internal services (e.g., CI/CD pipelines, internal dashboards) or enabling site-to-site networking without complex firewall rules.
3. [Twingate](https://www.twingate.com/): its Relay and Connector architecture and API-first design make it ideal for things like securing access to databases, Kubernetes clusters, or legacy applications in multi-cloud or on-premises environments.

These providers focus on a framework called Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) which authorizes every connection attempt. 
## Securing the VPS
To improve security we should limit access to the VPS to SSH and disable other services.
We can also harden the SSH using:
- Install Fail2ban and configure backups
- Working only with SSH keys
- Reduce Idle timeout interval
- Disable passwords
- Disable x11 forwarding
- Use a different port
- Limit users' SSH access
- Disable root logins
- Use SSH proto 2
- Enable 2FA Authentication for SSH
Other changes that can be made to SSH: set ban time to 4 weeks and allow maximum 3 attempts.

## 2FA
We can use Google Authenticator which generates a six-digit code (OTP) every 30 seconds to authenticate our identity. We can install it on our smartphone and we need Google-Authenticator PAM Module on our VPS. Emergency scratch codes should be saved safely in case we lose our phones.

After completing these security measures we can use [SCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_copy_protocol) to transfer our resources to the VPS.
